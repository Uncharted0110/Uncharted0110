### 👋 About Me

Hi, I'm **Uncharted0110**, your average coder who spends more time fighting bugs than actually writing code. But hey, if there’s no struggle, there’s no progress, right? I’m passionate about **computer graphics**, **ray tracing**, and **real-time rendering**. When I’m not buried in lines of code, I’m probably binge-watching some indie movie, tweaking my favorite algorithm, or thinking about my next big project.

I code in **C++**, **Python**, and **Java**, and I thrive on challenging myself to build things that make people say, “Wait, how does that even work?”
