### 🧠 About Me

- 🎮 I love **building worlds** — be it in graphics, games, or just complex systems.
- 🧱 Currently diving deep into **computer graphics**, **ray tracing**, and **real-time rendering**.
- ⚙️ Languages I speak: **C++**, **Python**, **Java**
- 🛠 Tools I enjoy: `OpenGL`, `Vulkan`, `Unity`, `Blender (just a bit!)`, `VSCode`, `Git`

### 💡 Fun Facts

- 🧠 I think in matrices sometimes (not healthy, but hey).
- ☕ I'm 90% caffeine, 10% curiosity.
- 🎧 My code flows smoother with James Blake & Sufjan Stevens in the background.
- 😅 Once procrastinated by debugging a non-existent bug. It was a comment.  
- 🐢 Slow and steady is great... unless you’re a renderer.
